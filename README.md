This are all my personal config files which I use for coding

## installation

**Disclaimer** I guess that It'd be kinda hard to keep this file up to date. So if I'd mess up some installation steps - PRs are welcomed ðŸ˜Œ

**Disclaimer 2** I'm using MacOS, so all this stuff are written for usage by me

### Step 1: setup iTerm2

1. Install [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) - Terminal emulator for macOSX.

2. Install [iTerm2 Oceanic Theme](https://github.com/mhartington/oceanic-next-iterm) - Oceanic theme for Iterm. Provides seamless UI experience between Neovim + Tmux. Instruction for that should be in theme repository.

3. Install [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#option-4-homebrew-fonts).

4. Set _Hack Nerd Font_ for Iterm in Preferences > Profiles > Text.

5. Change iTerm2 preferences folder to a one from this repo in Preferences > General > Preferences.
